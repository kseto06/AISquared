POWERCAST REFERENCE:

move : the entire attack 
power : a broad action 
cast : a single arrangement of hitboxes, which last for set frames and do set damage

DESCRIPTION:

it's like how a Band object might have a list of Musicians in it

the band doesn't produce music, the musicians within it do

similarly, the power doesn't produce hitboxes, the casts within it do

the power just is the admin, executing the data from the casts in order, and switching to another power when needed

(like how bands in a concert might switch out. if band1 does well, band 2 plays next. if band1 does bad, band 3 plays next)

in this case, if power1 hits the opponent, power2 plays. if power1 doesn't hit, then power 3 plays.

and in all these cases, the power is not directly storing data on attack damage or hitboxes. the casts within it, that are played in order, do.
	
we never just load a power w/o casts, just as we never would load a band object without immediately loading and using all the musicians
 
a default move has 3 powers: the main attacking motion, the on-hit end, and the no-hit end

it needs two ends cause the cooldown must differ
    
since hitting should reward the attacker with less cooldown (easier follow up)

and missing should reward the defendant with more cooldown (easier to counter attack)
    
so moves by default have 3 powers

EXAMPLE: POWERCASTING WITH THROWING A PAIR OF SUNGLASSES (inspired by Mortal Kombat Johnny Cage)

the sunglasses move holds

1. initial throw
2. punch if it hits
3. refresh glasses if it doesnt hit

the sunglasses move also says to start at power 1

and then power 1 says
-> if i hit, go to 2
-> if i don't hit, go to 3

power 1 also has info on the attack itself, in the form of an ordered list of casts:
1. take off glasses and animate
2. throw them, making an object and hitboxes
3. keep moving the hitboxes
